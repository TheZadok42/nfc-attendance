# NFC attendance POC

This is a simple POC for an NFC attendance sensor written for the RPI zero using a simple [NFC sensor](https://www.waveshare.com/pn532-nfc-hat.htm).

**NOTICE**

1.  The code at the [`libs`](./libs) folder belongs to [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/)  
    It was formatted by me, but written by [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/)
2.  This repo requires a working DAL to communicate to, but exists as an POC for the sensor.
